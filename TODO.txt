find a good place to send verify request
- can we have verification built into the list_files command?
    - the server or falcon node will verify the connection first before sending files

- add visual indicators of loading requests (list files and transfer)

- transfer should be able to be performed both ways

- display file size
    - should folder size be 4096 B or sum of contents?
    - Parker will change list command to not be recursive
    - folders should be 4096
    - don't recursively sum up content, just display individual file size

- add error handling

- fix updating node statuses

BY NEXT WEEK

- redirect users to “transfer status/history page” after initiating transfer to prevent spam requests
    - disable buttons while transfer is running

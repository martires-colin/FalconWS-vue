find a good place to send verify request
- can we have verification built into the list_files command?
    - the server or falcon node will verify the connection first before sending files

- add visual indicators of loading requests (list files and transfer)

- add error handling

- fix updating node statuses

- automatically open most recent transfer

- save state of dashboard

BY NEXT WEEK
- integrate new falcon Node
